The loan management system dashboard is a tool designed to help lenders track and manage their loan portfolio. It provides a comprehensive overview of loan performance, including key metrics such as loan balance, interest rate, and repayment status. The dashboard allows users to filter and sort data by various criteria, such as loan type, borrower credit score, and loan status.

The dashboard consists of several worksheets, each containing databases and payment sheet. The main worksheet displays a summary of the entire loan portfolio, including the total amount , total amount paid, and annual rates of loans in each repayment status and some others. Other worksheets provide more detailed information about individual loans, such as borrower information, loan terms, and payment history.

The loan management system dashboard is highly flexible, allowing users to add or remove data fields  as needed. It is an effective tool for tracking and analyzing loan performance, and can help lenders make informed decisions about their loan portfolio.
